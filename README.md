# New way to visualize your data

### Using Dash (built over Flask Python web-framework)
[Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) is built with the help of the [React](https://reactjs.org/) structure internally, which made it work really fast, even made live-graphing possible.

### Insights and motivation
Twitter streaming data can be classified in real-time using various ML-techniques and updated right away inside the app using Dash as visualization tool

### Where is it running
It is currently deployed with free account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Hosted on this funky webpage - [fatidique-livre](https://fatidique-livre-89162.herokuapp.com/)
